# AEROPHILIA 2022 | ORGANIZER APPLICATION

A Flutter Application built specifically for Aerophilia 2022, a Techno-Cultural fest.

An application for the Organizers of AEROPHILIA 2022.
This app is supposed to help the organizers keep track, send updates, and verify the participants of the techno-cultural fest.

## Features

- The application requires a fixed passkey to access the database securely.
- The passkey needs to be entered only once during the app initialization process, ensuring that the database and app functionality are accessible only to authorized users.
- Along with the passkey, the app also requires a digital signature to be entered. This allows for tracking changes made to the database and attributing them to the respective user.
- Additionally, the application provides quick contact features via WhatsApp or phone call. Users can search for contacts based on names or designations.
- The app supports scanning participant QR codes to verify their participation status.
- Users can use the app to modify participant statuses, such as approving payments, creating new participation entries, and marking attendance. These changes are immediately reflected in the database.
